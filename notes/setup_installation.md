#Installation

* Referenced [elixir-lang](http://elixir-lang.org/install.html) and installed with
  homebrew.
* Before download was finished, followed prompt by homebrew to set `EXENV_ROOT` to the directory where
  homebrew installed elixir. Started new shell, tested by running iex.
* Installed version manager [exenv](https://github.com/mururu/exenv).
  Exenv points to EXENV_ROOT, so totally okay with path. Started new
  shell, tested by viewing versions `$ exenv versions`.
* Installed [elixir-builder](https://github.com/mururu/elixir-build) (like ruby-build with rbenv). Started new shell, tested by viewing avialable elixir versions `$ exenv install -l`.
* Proceeded to install version 1.0.5, checked to see if the version
  persisted.
* Done!
